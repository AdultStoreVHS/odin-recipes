        <h1>Chicken Cordon Blue</h1>
        <img width="350px" src="../images/cordon-bleu.jpg" alt="cordon blue plated and cut">
        <p>Now we are getting fancy. This is good ol american twist on the high class French dish. Fried chicken, cheese and bacon. What else can you ask for? Its like the double down from KFC but you wont get a dirty look eating it. If you are looking for the "proper" recipe then sorry to disappoint. This version is the americanized version meant to be easy and not require ingredients you will buy once and forget in the back of your fridge.</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <p>This part is simple, just a few things you likely have sitting in your fridge.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Mozzarella Cheese(stick or block)</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Peanut Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chef time</h2>
        <p>Now to roll them sleeves up and act like your Bourdain. If you have ever fried chicken before this is going to be a bit of a cake walk. Remember this is "French" dish so make sure to pair it with your best wine under 10 bucks. White is probably the best pick here but ill stick to my Rum and Coke.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First your going to cook your bacon, and put it to the side for later</li>
            <li>Now you will whisk your egg in a bowl and do the same for your flour with the seasoning</li>
            <li>Next start the preheat of your oil in a pot to about 370 degrees</li>
            <li>While that heats its time to filet your chicken breast in half</li>
            <li>Once cut pound the breast till it almost uniform in thickness</li>
            <li>Take the flattened breast and add your shredded mozzarella and bacon to the middle</li>
            <li>Roll it up tighter than you rolled in college</li>
            <li>Once rolled you you may want to stick a toothpick or metal pick through the middle to hold if not rolled tightly</li>
            <li>Take the rolled breast and dip it in the flour first followed by the egg and back again</li>
            <li>After the breast has a nice think flour cake layer slowly add it to the oil</li>
            <li>The cooking should take about 15 minutes or till you reach an internal temp of 160</li>
            <li>Remove from oil and allow to cool for a moment, or don't if you want to eat lava be my guest</li>
            <li>Assuming you let it cool its time to enjoy your French Double down</li>

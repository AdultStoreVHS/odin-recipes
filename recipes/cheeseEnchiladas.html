        <h1>Cheese Enchiladas</h1>
        <p>Another classic if you live in the good ol state of Tejas. Name another recipe so simple it only calls for 4 ingredients. Yes more can be added if you wanted to spice things up or make them a 5 out of 5 but with just the base 4 your getting a solid 4/5. In short all cheese enchiladas are just corn tortillas covered in sauce and stuffed with more cheese than Houston traffic.</p>

        <p>As stated earlier you only need 4 ingredients to make this</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Small can of enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>Small can of chili without beans</li>
            <li>A comicly large bag of shredded mexican cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: the cheese needs to be a blend of cheeses and the best off the shelf option is mexican. Using all one type can give some funky results.</p>
        <h3>Some assembly required</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat your oven to 375</li>
            <li>Mix equal parts chili and sauce into bowl larger than the tortillas</li>
            <li>Put down a small layer of this mix in the pan you plan on cooking in</li>
            <li>Steam your tortillas to avoid breakage</li>
            <li>Now dip the tortillas in the sauce getting a light coating on each side</li>
            <li>place the dipped tortilla in the cooking pan and stuff with cheese</li>
            <li>Once stuffed you will roll the tortilla like your back in collage, trying not to break the shell</li>
            <li>Repeat this step till the pan is filled</li>
            <li>Now add a thin layer of cheese to the top</li>
            <li>Lastly dizzle some of the remainign sauce on the top</li>
            <li>Now place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes or still cheese is molten and bubbling</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ta Da, if you followed the steps you now have a pan of molten cheese goodness looking back at you.</p>

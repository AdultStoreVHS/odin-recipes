        <h2>The classic heart stopper</h2>
        <p>Not much else can be said about the chicken fried steak to be honest. Its a cheap cut of meat, dredged in egg, flour and seasoning then fried till perfection. I'd be willing to bet my bottom dollar that this thing has killed more people than that mary j ever has. </p>
        <p>To summon this ingot of gold you will need the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cube steak or cheap cut of beef</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>A selection of seasonings</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Peanut oil</li>
            <li>A can do attitude</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creating gold</h2>
            <p>Once you have assembled the chicken fried stones you just need to get them slapped into that oven mit gauntlet. So follow the steps and you wont lose your eye in the quest for this knowledge</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To start you will want to get your oil into a pot and get it up to about 370 degrees</li>
                <li>Next you will break one egg into a medium sized bowl and add a dash of milk, then mix till a creamy.</li>
                <li>AFter that you will want to take your flour and seasonings and blend them into bowl</li>
                <li>To the meat, go ahead and tenderize the steak like its Caesar on the ides of March. Get in there and get it about a quarter inch thick.</li>
                <li>Now the art, you will want to dredge your steak in the flour then in to the egg mix and back.</li>
                <li>Now that you have a nice layer of flour caked on the the steak its fry time</li>
                <li>Once the steak its caked slowly add it to the oil</li>
                <li>You will let it cook for about 10 minutes, at this point it will have a stop to bubble as much and have a nice brown finish for a crust.</li>
            </ol>
